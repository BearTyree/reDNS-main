# skRebel reDNS

reDNS is a library/daemon which allows any application with http/s (CONNECT) proxy support use dns over https

Usage is simple, simply launch the reDNS daemon and point your application to use http://localhost:8234 as the http proxy
Currently the only supported server is google dns (8.8.8.8) but this will be changed soon

### Features
* Light
* Portable (nodejs)
* Easily embeddable into other application to bypass firewalls (photoshop, dreamweaver, creative cloud, nvidia drivers)
* Secure using dns over https
